// Old Instructions Below

Welcome to the PPC Coach Keyword Tracking System (PPCCKTS for short, I really need a better name for it...)

There are a couple files in this zip and you should be aware of a couple things:

1.) Read this whole readme.txt file before doing anything.
2.) All files except this one, config.php and key.txt are zend encoded.
3.) This script is written to be used with php5, mysql and zend optimizer 3.x, if your hosting does not support any one of these, the scripts will not work.  The solution is get a better host or be out of luck in being able to use this fine product!  (I use serverprovider.com tell Sami I sent you...)
4.) If you have questions, please post them in the forums, in the tracker forum.
5.) If you're not promoting PPC Coach yet and earning more then your membership fee each month, then you should be, go here: ppc-coach.com/aff and sign up now!

Installation Instructions:

1.) Unzip the file.
2.) Create a database on your server and a username and password for the database.
3.) Edit config.php to reflect your information.
4.) Upload all files to your server.
5.) Run "install-tables.php" on your server, (this installs the necessary tables in your database).
6.) Chmod the file key.txt to 777

That's it.

The script is now installed and you view it by navigating to the index.php file on your server.  You will be asked to login and then you can start using the system.

I will be posting extensive documentation and videos on how to use the system for all your keyword tracking needs and the system is in a constant state of updgrading as new features are brought online.  This will NEVER affect your existing data though.

Please stay tuned to the forums for updates!

All the best,

PPC Coach
