1.13.1  - Minor bug fixes (->toXml tags now correct in LocalBusinessAd objects, one (int) cast corrected
          to (double), reports did not return the download URL when a TSV report was requested)

1.13.0  Be sure to read http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/releasenotes.html before this
        Changelog in order to make sense of the shortened list of changes below.
        
        - AdGroup status field values renamed to original set ["Enabled", "Paused", "Deleted"], as documented
          in http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/AdGroup.html#status. Previous APIlity versions
          had "Enabled" renamed to "Active" in accordance with the "Active" state of Campaigns. The current
          change is to prevent confusions and discrepancies between the API itself and the APIlity library.
        - New geo targeting options excluded{Countries|Cities|Regions|Metros}. See
          http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/GeoTarget.html for details.
              * (modified) CampaignObject->setGeoTargets(...)
        - New function getActiveCampaigns in order to obtain only active Campaigns. This allows for fast
          retrieval of your Campaigns without having to wait for deleted, paused etc. Campaigns (i.e. returns
          _only_ Active Campaigns). With the standard getAllCampaigns() function and APIlity's setting
          Return_Deleted_Objects you can also filter the deleted Campaigns (i.e. returns all _but_ Deleted
          Campaigns).
              * (new) getActiveCampaigns()
        - New function getActiveAdGroups in order to obtain only active AdGroups. This allows for fast
          retrieval of your AdGroups without having to wait for deleted, paused etc. AdGroups (i.e. returns
          _only_ Enabled AdGroups). With the standard getAllAdGroups() function and APIlity's setting
          Return_Deleted_Objects you can also filter the deleted AdGroups (i.e. returns all _but_ Deleted
          AdGroups).      
              * (new) getActiveAdGroups()
        - New function getRecommendedBudget(). Returns the recommended budget for a Campaign, if a suggestion
          is available.
              * (new) CampaignObject->getRecommendedBudget()
        - New fields in KeywordCriterion objects: firstPageCpc, qualityScore.              
              * (new) KeywordCriterionObject->get{FirstPageCpc|QualityScore}
        - Removed field in KeywordCriterion objects: minCpc.
              * (removed) KeywordCriterionObject->getMinCpc
        - As minCpc is no longer supported, removed matchMaxCpcsToMinCpcs and matchMaxCpcToMinCpc.
              * (removed) KeywordCriterionObject->matchMaxCpcToMinCpc()        
              * (removed) AdGroupObject->matchMaxCpcsToMinCpcs()
        - Removed field isEnabledSeparateContentBids from Campaign objects. This changes the function parameters in
          all Campaign-creating functions:              
              * (modified) addCampaign()
              * (modified) addCampaignsOneByOne()
              * (modified) addCampaignList()                     
              * (removed) CampaignObject->getIsEnabledSeparateContentBids
        - New ad type MobileImageAd. 
              * (new) addMobileImageAd(...)                      
              * (new) addMobileImageAdList(...)                      
              * (new) addMobileImageAdsOneByOne(...)                                    
        - New function getClientsClientAccountInfos and getManagersClientAccountInfos. The first function gets
          the account information of the "clientEmail" field, the latter of the "email" field in the
          authentication context (as in getClientsClientAccounts and getManagersClientAccounts).
              * (new)  getClientsClientAccountInfos()
              * (new)  getManagersClientAccountInfos()                     
        - New function getMccAlerts. Gets the alerts of any account in your My Client Center.
              * (new)  getMccAlerts()
        - Keyword Tool now returns average search volume and last month search volume data. See 
          http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/KeywordVariation.html and
          http://code.google.com/apis/adwords/docs/developer/SiteKeyword.html for details. Therefore the
          information on searchVolumeScale has been removed. 
        - New report types search query performance and geographic performance report.
              * (new)  getSearchQueryXmlReport(...)                             
              * (new)  getSearchQueryTsvReport(...)                             
              * (new)  getGeographicXmlReport(...)                             
              * (new)  getGeographicTsvReport(...)  
        - Option to set an HTTP proxy via settings.ini.
        - Option to use a separate settings.ini file for each APIlity instance. You provide the location of your
          settings.ini file via the APIlityUser constructor:
          $apilityUser = new APIlityUser(
              'email',
              'password',
              'clientEmail',
              'developerToken',
              'applicationToken',
              'path/to/settings.ini')
          (Thanks to Sander Marechal for the idea)
        - Option to use a separate authentication.ini file for each APIlity instance. You provide the location
          of your authentication.ini file via the APIlityUser constructor:
          $apilityUser = new APIlityUser(
              'email',
              'password',
              'clientEmail',
              'developerToken',
              'applicationToken',
              'path/to/settings.ini',
              'path/to/authentication.ini')
        - Campaigns by default no longer obtain all the Campaign Negative Keywords in order to save API units.
          (Thanks to Andrew for the remark)
        - New function getCriterionListStats. This function obtains statistics for a list of Criteria.
          (Thanks to Mick for the implementation of the function)
        - Option to retrieve only the download URL in reports rather than the report data. Therefore pass
          true in the last argument of the report retrieval function, e.g.
          getKeywordXmlReport(
              $name, 
              $startDay,
              $endDay,
              $selectedColumns,
              $aggregationTypes,
              $campaigns,
              $campaignStatuses,
              $adGroups,
              $adGroupStatuses,
              $keywords,
              $keywordStatuses,
              $adWordsType,
              $keywordType,
              $isCrossClient,
              $clientEmails,
              $includeZeroImpression,
              $sleepTime,
              $validateFirst,
              $onlyReturnDownloadUrl)          
        - Removed all (int) casts in order to prevent integer overflows and replaced them by (float) casts.
          (Thanks to Jan and Sander for the bug reports and investigations)
        - Report retrieval no longer uses the buffer in order to facilitate command line usage of APIlity.
          (Thanks to Mark W. for the implementation)
        - The test suite has been updated in order to work in the object-oriented mode.
        - Included PHP files have been renamed from .inc to .inc.php.
          (Thanks to Bert for the remark)
        - If APIlity runs with PHP4 and if object-oriented mode is activated, an incompatibility warning gets
          displayed. 
        - All APIlity warnings now use the proper trigger_error function with E_USER_WARNING error type.      
        - Simplified APIlityUser instantiation internally. Removed Authentication.php. All valid context-
          switching options are listed here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Authentication_and_Context_Switching
          If you have object-oriented mode disabled, you now need to instantiate the APIlityUser object. See
          project.php for an example:
          $apilityUser = new APIlityUser
          
1.12.2  - Bug fix in AdGroup.inc and Campaign.inc where deleted objects where not returned, even if the flag in
          settings.ini was set.
          (Thanks to Thomas GrÃ¼bel for the bug report and bug fix)
        - Bug fix where a typo in Report.php caused reports not to succeed in case of where PHP4 was used.
          (Thanks to Gordon Brown and Tony Wade for the bug reports and fixes)
        - Bug fix in Ad.inc where checkAdList failed because there was no Ad Group ID specified (0 now)
          (Thanks to Stefania Calamai for the bug report and fix)
        - Bug fix in Ad.inc where unset values caused PHP warnings.
          (Thanks to Andrew Komasinski for the bug report and fix)
        - Bug fix in Campaign.inc where unset geo target settings caused PHP warnings
          (Thanks to Mikey Tag for the bug report and fix)

              * (new) CampaignObject->setConversionOptimizerSettings()
              * (new) AdGroupObject->{get|set}MaxCpa()          
        - Added CPC bidding for placement-targeted Campaigns. This adds and/or changes the interface of the
          following functions:
              * (new) AdGroupObject->{get|set}SiteMaxCpc()
              * (new) WebsiteCriterionObject->{get|set}MaxCpc()
              * (modified) addAdGroup()
              * (modified) addAdGroupList()
              * (modified) addAdGroupsOneByOne()
              * (modified) addWebsiteCriterion()
        - New budget fields in Campaign. Two new fields â budgetAmount and budgetPeriod â replace dailyBudget.
          To use an existing Campaign's budget with the new structure, set budgetPeriod to Daily and budgetAmount
          to the existing campaign's budget.      
              * (new) CampaignObject->{get|set}BudgetAmount()
              * (new) CampaignObject->{get|set}BudgetPeriod()                        
              * (removed) CampaignObject->getDailyBudget()
              * (modified) addCampaign()
              * (modified) addCampaignList()
              * (modified) addAdCampaignsOneByOne()              
        - New function removeCriterionList to remove several Criteria at a time
              * (new) removeCriterionList()
        - New function getCustomizedKeywordListEstimate that allows you to receive the same results as with the tool at
          https://adwords.google.com/select/TrafficEstimatorSandbox.
              * (new) getCustomizedKeywordListEstimate()
        - New setting to configure whether to return deleted objects like Campaigns, AdGroups, etc., or to rather hide them.
          See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Deleted_Objects for details.
        - Read-only fields added to LocalBusinessAd. Three new read-only fields (fullBusinessName, latitude, and longitude)
          are now available.
              * (new) LocalBusinessAdObject->get{FullBusinessName|Latitude|Longitude}          
        - Changed timeout settings in NuSOAP.
          (Thanks to Vladimir Kornea)                          
        - Added XML special characters escaping for ->toXml() functions.

          See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#report for details.        
        - Added unit conversion for all eligible fields in reports (micros to actual currency).          
        - Fixed many documentation bugs (please keep posting any documentation bug that you come across).

1.11.3  - Added support for the new Account Structure report type.
          See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#report for details.

1.11.2  - Bug fix for TrafficEstimate.php where getMaxCpc() was not correctly renamed to
          getKeywordMaxCpc().
          (Thanks to Spacy for the bug report)
        - Bug fix for Report.php where custom values got overridden by default values.
          (Thanks to Denis [one 'n'] Vaillant for the bug report and the bug fix)  
        - Fixed a bug in validateReportJob where the missing XML namespace caused the function to fail.
          (Thanks to Denis Vaillant for the bug report)
        - Added Campaign end date handling. Now you can set endDate to empty string in order to create
          never-ending Campaigns in addCampaign(...), addCampaignList(...), and addCampaignsOneByOne(...).
        - Modified behavior for set{Headline|Description1|Description2|DestinationUrl|DisplayUrl}(...) where
          the status of updated Ads was always set to Enabled instead of copying the original status.
          (Thanks to JÃ¼rgen Kaatz, Mikev, Vladimir Kornea, and Jan Piotrowski for the lively discussion)
        - Added a new mode for object-oriented programming. This allows you to program acting as an 
          APIlityUser or APIlityManager with easier access to quota and debugging information.
          See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Object_Orientation for details. This, as mentioned, simplifies
          the way you can access authentication, quota, fault, and debugging information. See the following
          links for details:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Authentication_and_Context_Switching
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Fault_Stack
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Quota_Usage_in_APIlity
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Debugging             
          You can also check the new project_oo.php sample project.

          (Thanks to Wes Winham for the bug report and the bug fix)                
        - Bug fix for $someSoapClient not being instantiated in campaign.php
          (Thanks to Wes Winham for the bug report and the bug fix)        
        - This for some reason did not make it in the 1.11.0 Changelog... New field belongsToClientEmail
          for campaigns.
          See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#campaign-getBelongsToClientEmail%28%29.
              * (new) ->getBelongsToClientEmail()        
          (Thanks to Vladimir Kornea for the feature suggestion)        

1.11.0  - New flexible report interface. The report interface has changed in v11 to expand the range

              * (new) getAccountTsvReport
              * (new) getAccountXmlReport
              * (new) getAdGroupTsvReport
              * (new) getAdGroupXmlReport
              * (new) getCampaignTsvReport
              * (new) getCampaignXmlReport
              * (new) getCreativeTsvReport

              * (new) getReachAndFrequqencyTsvReport
              * (new) getReachAndFrequqencyXmlReport
              * (new) getUrlTsvReport
              * (new) getUrlXmlReport
          Please see the particular function's section in the docs and please have a look at the provided
          samples: http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#report. Be sure to read
          http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/developer/adwords_api_reports.html in order to get the
          column selection right.
        - Renamed AdGroup CPC and CPM fields - To avoid ambiguity, some AdGroup CPC and CPM fields have
          been renamed by adding "keyword" or "site", to distinguish whether they apply to a keyword or
          website. This influences the following functions:
              * (old) ->{get|set}MaxContentCpc
              * (new) ->{get|set}KeywordContentMaxCpc
              * (old) ->{get|set}MaxCpc
              * (new) ->{get|set}KeywordMaxCpc
              * (old) ->getProxyMaxCpc
              * (new) ->getProxyKeywordMaxCpc
              * (old) ->{get|set}MaxCpm
              * (new) ->{get|set}SiteMaxCpm
              * (modified) ->getAdGroupData
              * (modified) addAdGroupList()
              * (modified) addAdGroupsOneByOne()
        - Images (image ads) now return a shrunkenUrl field.
        - Removed the ability to set the login email address or password
              * (removed) setLoginInfo()
        - If you set Campaign end day to a date both after 2006/12/31 and not 2007/12/30, the
          service will throw an exception. In previous versions, CampaignService silently rounded
          such out-of-range dates. 2007/12/30 is a special constant that causes the Campaign to never end.

1.10.4  - Replaced global variables $authenticationContext, $faultStack, and $soapClients by
          static variables. In order to use these variables now, you need to get the reference
          to the particular variable. See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Fault_Stack and
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Authentication_and_Context_Switching for updated
          examples.
          (Thanks to Yury Ksenevich for the patch)          
        - Fixed the invisible characters bug in NuSOAP that caused sessions to fail on initialization.
          (Thanks to Imran for the bug report and fix)        
        - Fixed a typo in Criterion.php where the maxCpc field was macCpc.
          (Thanks to Phil for the bug report and fix)        
        - Fixed a bug in checkCriterionList() where the optional destinationUrl and isNegative fields
          were strictly assumed.
          (Thanks to Phil for the bug report and fix)        
        - Fixed a bug in Ad.php for ImageAds, where the exemption request was missing. 
          (Thanks to Denis Vaillant for the bug report and fix)
        - downloadCsvReport() has been renamed to downloadTsvReport, as the function indeed returns tab-
          separated data, and not comma-separated data. The original function links back to the new function
          for compatibility reasons for some time. However, please update your code.
              * (old) ->downloadCsvReport()            
              * (new) ->downloadTsvReport()            
          (Thanks to Vladimir Kornea for the bug report and fix)       

1.10.3  - Bug fix in Criterion.php where in case of activated budget optimizer the MaxCPC field could
          not be muted (no it can be null).
          (Thanks to Wei for the bug report and the bug fix.)
        - Bug fix in nusoap.php where the EUR sign got munged when the file was saved UTF8-encoded
          (Thanks to Tom Churm for the bug report and the bug fix.)
        - Changed the NuSOAP debugging level which should solve memory leaks
          (Thanks to Phil and Chronofish for the bug report and fix)
        - Fixed the docs (removed old creative service stuff)
          (Thanks to Mark for the remark)

1.10.2  - Bug fix in Campaign.php where "Pending" Campaigns were not returned.
          (Thanks to Harsh for the bug report and the bug fix.)
1.10.1  - Bug fix for an error in Report.php which caused reports to fail in the sandbox.
          (Thanks to Aaron Karp and sempsteen for tracking this issue down to the solution)

1.10.0  - APIlity now supports the SiteSuggestion service. Please see 
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#sitesuggestion for details.
              * (new) getSitesByCategoryName(...)
              * (new) getSitesByDemographics(...)
              * (new) getSitesByTopics(...)
              * (new) getSitesByUrls(...)
        - New function checkKeywordTraffic. Please see
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#trafficestimate-checkKeywordListTraffic%28%24keywords%29
          for details.
              * (new) checkKeywordTraffic(...)
        - GeoTargeting modifications. Please see http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/developer/GeoTarget.html
          and the samples in the reference for details.
              * (modified) ->getGeoTargets()
              * (modified) ->setGeoTargets
              * (modified) addCampaign(...)
              * (modified) addCampaignsOneByOne()
              * (modified) addCampaignList()
              * (modified) addCampaignList()
              * (modified) checkCriterionList(...)
              * (modified) checkAdList(...)

        - Added support for currencies Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Vietnamese Dong (VND) and Serbian
          Dinar (RSD).
        - Modification with the createXxxObject functions: in case of an invalid ID, the functions
          now return null instead of false. This allows for more precise error handling.
          (Thanks to JÃ¼rgen for the suggestion.)
        - Bug fix of the method receiveCriterion() where the unit conversion happened two times.
          (Thanks to JÃ¼rgen for the bug report and the bug fix.)
        - Bug fix in Campaign.php where "Ended" Campaigns were not returned.
          (Thanks to Laurent for the bug report and the bug fix.)
        - Bug fix in Criterion.php where invalid indention caused an API exception.
          (Thanks to msrapi for the bug report and the bug fix.)
        - All files are saved in UTF-8 format now. This should solve any encoding issues. If you have
          to handle non-ASCII encoded data, please make sure to save your files in UTF-8 format.
          (Thanks to Thomas GrÃ¼bel and Marco T. for input and bug reports.)

1.9.0   - APIlity now supports Video Ads. This comes along with some new functions:
              * (new) addVideoAd(...)
              * (new) getMyVideos(...)
              * (new) ->getName()
              * (new) ->getVideo()
              * (new) ->getImage()
        - Added the request checkAdList to check a batch of ads for policy errors:
              * (new) checkAdList
        - Now all calls return statistics in the account's local timezone, no matter what. As such,
          removed the inPST parameter from the statistics requests.
        - Added an ability to get periodic emails on your account's performance and disapproved ads.
              * (modified) createEmailPreferencesXml(...)
              * (modified) updateAccountInfo(...)
        - In account infos replaced the field defaultAdsTargeting with defaultNetworkTargeting.
          Removed the field termsAndConditions (no replacement).
              * (modified) updateAccountInfo(...)
        - New Active/InActive status for keyword and criterion - Active status replaces Normal and
          Inactive replaces OnHold in KeywordStatus and CriterionStatus.
        - Removed Creative Service. Use AdService instead, which has improved functionality.
        - Bugfix in Ad.php concerning Ad removal.
          (Thanks to Denis Vaillant for the bug report and fix)
        - Bugfix in AdGroup.php concerning AdGroup parsing.
          (Thanks to JÃ¼rgen Kaatz for the bug report and fix)
        - Bugfix concerning encoding issues with special characters on Ad/Creative updates
          (Thanks to Thomas GrÃÂ¼bel ;-) for the bug report)
        - Bugfix concerning the keyword tools in case where only one element was returned
        - Bugfix concerning createXxxObject functions in case of invalid IDs
          (Thanks to Phil Fernandez for the bug report and fix)
        - Bugfix with addVideoAd where a parameter was missing
          (Thanks to Denis Vaillant for the bug report and fix)
        - Bugfix concerning report scheduling where the XML namespace was missing
          (Thanks to Denis Vaillant for the bug report and fix)

1.8.1   - Code refactoring and minor bugfixes concerning nillable values.
          All classes now have a receive{Campaign|...|Criterion} function that does the mapping
          between API-returned values and APIlity objects in order to simplify debugging and code
          maintenance.

1.8.0   - Enables all features of the previous sandbox-only release
        - New sandbox feature:
              * CommerceAd
          Please see http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#ad for details.

1.8.0_sandbox
        - A new field budgetOptimizerSettings in Campaign allows you use a budget optimizer. You can
          enable or disable the optimizer and set a ceiling on bids placed by the optimizer (proxy bids).
          While turning off the budget optimizer, you can also specify whether or not the optimized proxy
          bids replace the original user bids.
          When the budget optimizer is enabled, proxy bids will be placed by the budget optimizer and used
          in place of your manual bids.
        - You can view the status of these bids in the field proxyMaxCpc on AdGroup and Keyword. Initially,
          before the budget optimizer has a chance to calculate bids, the adgroups will take on a default
          proxyMaxCpc that is the minimum currency value, and the keywords will have no proxy bids. Shortly
          thereafter, these bids will be adjusted, and you will see individual proxy keyword bids show up.
          You will still be able to read your manual bids (maxCpc) while the budget optimizer is on.

        - New service AdService provides improved functionality over CreativeService and will eventually replace it.
          See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#ad for details.
          Ads have different visual representations for different targets:
              * Local Business Ads - Data associated with ads on Google Maps
              * Mobile Ads - Data associated with ads on a mobile phone
              * Image Ads - Data associated with image ads
              * Text Ads - Data associated with text-only ads
        - Check creatives and criteria - Two methods have been added to check creatives and criteria:
              * (new) checkCriteria
              * (new) checkCreativeList
        - Several minor bug fixes
          (Thanks to David Morandi for the bugfix)

1.7.0   - Campaigns now support ad scheduling. This comes along with two new functions and
          modified parameters for the add functions
              * (modified) addCampaign(...)
              * (modified) addCampaignList(...)
              * (modified) addCampaignsOneByOne(...)
              * (new) ->getAdScheduling()
              * (new) ->setAdScheduling(...)
          In consequence the Campaign object structure has changed and has now an additional
          attribute "adScheduling". Please check the Campaign section of the reference and the
          following page for details about ad scheduling:
          https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=33227&query=ad+scheduling&topic=&type=f
        - Now you can use updateCriteria to do updates across different AdGroups. For example, you can
          set the Keyword maxCpc or language in various AdGroups with a single call (no
          change to API, just to the semantics).
        - Removed method to set local timezone
               * (removed) setLocalTimezone(...)
        - Removed method to create an AdWords account and the related XML helper functions
               * (removed) createAdWordsAccount(...)
        - Removed deprecated setters and getters from AccountService. All account functions are
          now exclusively accessible using updateAccountInfo().
        - New function getCreditCard for accessing credit card information
               * (new) getCreditCard()
        - Creatives and Criteria can now be paused (currently a sandbox-only feature). This feature
          comes along with modifications in the Creative and Criterion object structure.
          Creatives now have a new attribute "status" which replaces the old "isDeleted" attribute.
               * (removed) ->getIsDeleted()
               * (new) ->getStatus()
               * (new) ->setStatus(...) // "Paused" or "Enabled"
          For Criteria there has been simply introduced a new attribute "isPaused"
               * (new) ->getIsPaused()
               * (new) ->setIsPaused(...)

1.6.3   - Bugfix for the typo bug in Report_v6.php which caused invalid XML to be generated.
          (Thanks to Joost de Mes who posted this bugfix)
        - Bugfix for the geo target features of Campaigns which did not work correctly in case
          where just one geo target of a specific type was selected.
          (Thanks to Phil Fernandez who posted this bugfix)
        - New function for retrieving a list of Criteria
              * (new) getCriterionList(...) 
          (Thanks to JÃ¼rgen Kaatz who contributed this function)
        - New function for retrieving a list of AdGroups
              * (new) getAdGroupList(...) 
          (Thanks to JÃ¼rgen Kaatz who contributed this function)

1.6.2_fixed
        - Depending on the account's time zone, today's date may be interpreted to be in the past,
          and thus Campaigns cannot be added due to an error message. To prevent this, simply leave
          the startDate parameter of addCampaign, addCampaignList, and addCampaignsOneByOne empty,
          if you want to start the Campaign(s) directly after their creation.

1.6.2   - Added support for the new function getCreativeStats
              * (new) getCreativeStats(...)

1.6.1   - Added support for multiple geo target types. This allows you to target Campaigns
          in several regions, cities, and metros; or countries, and territories at the same time.
          Please note that there are several restrictions. Legal options are:
          * a list of countries, and territories
          XOR
          * a combination of one or more regions, metropolitan areas, and cities within a single
            country or territory, where one item may not be contained in a more general item.
          In consequence, the geoTargetType attribute of Campaigns has been removed. See
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/resources/apility_hierarchy.png for an updated
          object hierarchy. This also has an impact on the following function parameters or
          return types:
              * (modified) addCampaign(...)
              * (modified) addCampaignList(...)
              * (modified) addCampaignsOneByOne(...)
              * (modified) getGeoTargets()
              * (modified) setGeoTargets(...)
              * (modified) $campaignObject->toXml()
          The following function has been removed:
              * (old) getGeoTargetType()
          See http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#campaign for details.
        - Minor bugfix: the introduction of settable start dates can result in the Campaign status
          "Pending". Such Campaigns were not listed via getAllCampaigns.
          (Thanks to Sserv for posting a patch to the forum)

1.6.0   !! Major Update !!
        - With the introduction of version 6 of the API, all applications must identify
          themselves with a unique application token. This application token needs to
          be set in authentication.ini, or via
          $authenticationContext = new APIlityAuthentication(
            $email,
            $password,
            $developerToken,
            $clientEmail,
            $applicationToken);
          All details are listed here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Authentication_and_Context_Switching
        - The error format has been changed, and in case of failing list function the 
          error message now gives a much better insight in what actually went wrong by reporting
          all errors at once, instead of just the first error.
          All details are listed here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Error_Message_Styles
        - The depreciated Keyword service has been finally removed. This means that all functions 
          that used to be offered by the Keyword class are gone. Also on AdGroup objects you
          can no longer call $adGroupObject->getAllKeywords() and
          $adGroupObject->getAllActiveKeywords(). Use $adGroupObject->getAllCriteria() instead.
        - In order to simplify Report generation, the class Report has been completely re-designed.
          The old functions
              * (old) getCsvReport(...)
              * (old) getXmlReport(...)
          have been completely replaced by eight new functions:
              * (new) getAccountReportJob(...)
              * (new) getAdTextReportJob(...)
              * (new) getAdGroupReportJob(...)
              * (new) getAdImageReportJob(...)
              * (new) getCampaignReportJob(...)
              * (new) getCustomReportJob(...)
              * (new) getKeywordReportJob(...)
              * (new) getUrlReportJob(...)
          This hopefully demystifies Report generation a lot. Please see the docs for the
          different functions here: http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#report
          Please note that the last few parameters are always optional, so the basic Reports
          should be really a lot easier to create. The first parameter always determines
          the Report type (XML or CSV).
          In addition to that, all Report types now support the new aggregation type 'weekly',
          while the types 'HourlyRegardlessDate' and 'HourlyByDate' are only supported by Campaign
          Reports and Account Reports.
        - With the new function
              * (new) getAccountInfo()
          you can now easily retrieve all the account's data at once, while the new function
              * (new) updateAccountInfo(...)
          allows you to set certain parameters at once.
        - Campaigns now support setting a start date instead of simply hard-wiring the start date
          to the creation date. This changes the parameters of the following functions:
              * (modified) addCampaign(...)
              * (modified) addCampaignList(...)
              * (modified) addCampaignsOneByOne(...)
          Now you need to pass a start date as well as an end date.
        - The new function
              * (new) getUnitCountsForClients(...)
          allows you to exactly determine quota consumption per client.
        - The function
              * (modified) createAdwordsAccount()
          now allows an additional field 'emailAddress' in the 'contactInfoXml' field, and
          a 'timeZoneId' field.
        - The debug mode can now be easily activated in the settings.ini file. See the docs here 
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Debugging for details.
        - A bug in getManagersClientAccounts() and in getClientsClientAccounts() has been fixed.
          (Thanks to JÃ¼rgen for the bug fix)

1.4.6   - Added sandbox support. This very useful feature is documented here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Sandbox
        - New function that allows you to receive a list of campaigns.
              * (new) getCampaignList()
        - Changed all class names so that now each class name has the prefix APIlity.
          This was done to prevent overlapping with existing class names in your code.
          The change does not affect you, unless you are using the $authenticationContext 
          variable. In either case you need to use:
              * (new) $authenticationContext = new APIlityAuthentication(...);
          instead of: 
              * (old) $authenticationContext = new Authentication(...);
          The change is documented here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Authentication_and_Context_Switching
        - The debug mode (http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Debugging) now comes with
          basic syntax highlighting when the error message style is set to HTML.
          (Thanks to Daniel O'Brien who implemented this feature.)
        - Re-fixed the getCsvReport() function which was broken again in the last release.
        - Fixed a bug in the traffic estimates of Campaigns and AdGroups
        - Fixed a bug in the getAllKeywords() and getAllActiveKeywords() function.
          (Thanks to Phil Fernandez who pointed to this bug.)

1.4.5   - Fixed the getCsvReport() function which was broken in the last release.
          (Thanks to Bernd (gogy) for pointing to this bug.)
        - Fixed a small bug in ->getAdGroupData() where an attribute was wrong.
          (Thanks to Paul Maunders for pointing to this bug.)
        - Fixed a small bug in ->getCriterionData() where an attribute was missing.
          (Thanks to Paul Maunders for pointing to this bug.)
        - Added the possibility to select different match types for Campaign Negative Criteria.
          This changes the parameters and return values of the following functions:
              $campaignObject->setCampaignNegativeKeywordCriteria()
              $campaignObject->setCampaignNegativeWebsiteCriteria()
              $campaignObject->getCampaignNegativeKeywordCriteria()
              $campaignObject->getCampaignNegativeWebsiteCriteria()
              $campaignObject->toXml()
          (Thanks to Norman Winzer who brought this topic up and contributed a slightly
          different solution to the problem.)

1.4.4a  - The ->toXml() method of Campaigns returned <endDay> and <startDay> tags instead
          of <endDate> and <startDate>. APIlity simply keeps the old names, unless in the
          native API the names have been changed. See the following links for details:
          v4: http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/developer/Campaign.html#endDay
          v3: http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/developer3/Campaign.html#endDate

        - Small correction in the logic: if there are no objects to return (e.g. when you
          call getAllCriteria() on an empty AdGroup), APIlity 1.4.4 returned false. APIlity
          1.4.4a just returns an empty array in either case.

        - The ->matchMaxCpcToMinCpc() method of AdGroups refers to Keyword objects when you
          use API v3 (according to your settings.ini file). When you use API v4, the same
          method now refers to Criterion objects.

        - The Traffic Estimations of AdGroups and Campaigns refer to Keyword objects when you
          use API v3 (according to your settings.ini file). When you use API v4, the Traffic
          Estimations now refer to Criterion objects.

        - To prevent annoying warnings, "foreach" loops now check if the iteration object is
          iterable.


1.4.4   - This version introduces support for API v4

        - There are three new functions concerning local timezone settings
              * (new) setLocalTimezone() (not yet enabled)
              * (new) getLocalTimezone()
              * (new) getTimezoneEffectiveDate()

        - API v4 has a new way of handling dates for
              * Stats (getCriterionStats(), getCampaignStats(), getAdGroupStats())
              * Reports (getXmlReport(), getCsvReport())
              * Campaign start/end dates ($campaignObject->setEndDate(), addCampaign(),
                addCampaignList(), addCampaignsOneByOne())
          Now you have to specify an xsd:date (rather than an xsd:datetime). The day will
          automatically be interpreted in the account's local time.
          In short: for the above contexts, modify your dates as follows:
              (old) 2011-12-17T12:00:00Z ->  (new) 2011-12-17

        - For the getXxxStats methods (getCriterionStats(), getCampaignStats(), getAdGroupStats())
          there is an optional new parameter which allows you to still retrieve stats in
          America/Los_Angeles timezone. It defaults to false (i.e. your local timezone will be
          used instead.
              * (new) inPST function parameter in getXxxStats methods

        - The parameters of getXmlReport() and getCsvReport() have been modified in order to support
          reporting on a list of accounts and in order to include zero impression criteria in Reports.
          Please check out the updated docs carefully:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#report-getXmlReport%28%24reportName%2C
          +%24reportType%2C+%24aggregationType%2C+%24startDate%2C+%24endDate%2C+%24sleepTime%29

        - The Traffic Estimator now supports ranges which comes along with six new fields. These new
          fields represent ranges instead of single values.
              * (old) avgPosition  -> (new) lowerAvgPosition, upperAvgPosition
              * (old) clicksPerDay -> (new) lowerClicksPerDay, upperClicksPerDay
              * (old) cpc          -> (new) lowerCpc, upperCpc

        - In order to simplify tracking of requests, a new unique request ID in the response header
          has been introduced. It can be made visible using APIlity's debugging option
          (http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/index.html#Debugging)

        - A minor bugfix for the traffic estimator which caused one element not to be included in the
          traffic estimate. In API v4 this bug never occurs. However, it might be important if you want
          to use API v3 until it gets deactivated.
          (Thanks to Adam Pountney for the bugfix)

1.4.0   !! Major Update !!

        - The error handling has been completely changed. A new error handling strategy
          has been introduced in order to make APIlity functions more reliable. The convention
          for the behavior of all functions is:
             * if something went wrong
                 => return false
             * if everything went well
                 => return the thing when there is something to return
                 => return true when there is nothing to return
          An exception of this are simple object get-functions as they require a successfully
          created object anyway. Please view http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Error_Management
          for details. In general, your old code should be fully compatible. The only exception is
          when your code was based on what was called "Central Error Collecting Array". In either
          case make sure to change your code to use the fault stack.

        - New error message styles: http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Error_Message_Styles

        - New Fault Stack: http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Fault_Stack

        - There is a new Silence Stealth Mode: http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Silence_Stealth_Mode

        - Campaign Negative Criteria have been handled as pseudo object attributes. Now they can be
          added transparently to Campaign objects. Please view
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/#Campaign_Negative_Criteria for details.
          Please note: this is _enabled_ by default and consumes 1 quota unit per item.

        - All objects (Campaign, AdGroup, WebsiteCriterion, KeywordCriterion, Keyword, Creative) now have
          an additional toXml() function. An example is documented here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/APIlity_Reference_Standalone.html#campaign-toXml%28%29

        - There are three new functions for the info service
              * (new) getUnitCountForMethod()
              * (new) getMethodCost()
              * (new) getUsageQuotaThisMonth()
          These functions are documented here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/APIlity_Reference_Standalone.html#info
          (Thanks to AIMpromote for this contribution)

        - The projet.php demo project has been updated and shows the toXml() feature and the defensive
          programming model.

        - The class structure has been cleaned up. The new class organigram is available here:
          http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/resources/apility_organigram.png

        - There is a new announcement-only group with very low traffic which is exclusively used
          to announce new releases, bugs ans bugfixes. Feel free to subscribe:
          URL: http://groups.google.com/group/APIlity-Announce
          Atom 1.0 feed: http://groups.google.com/group/APIlity-Announce/feed/atom_v1_0_msgs.xml

        - API v2 support has been disabled.

1.3.0_fixed
        - Definite bugfix for the "This account is empty" problem.
          (Thanks to Demjan for the hint in the forum)
        - Bugfix for addAdGroup() function for Campaigns with separate content bidding disabled
        - Bugfix for setCampaignNegativeXxxCriteria() functions which used to eliminate each other

1.3.0   !! Major update !!
        Update _required_ until March 27, 2006

        This version introduces the versioning feature and contains the step from API v2 to API v3
        By default APIlity uses the latest API version (v3). This can be changed by setting the
        Use_API_Version value from v3 to v2 in settings.ini
        (API v3 is the reason for the version step skip from APIlity 1.1.0 to 1.3.0)

        - AdGroups can now have separate content bids. Therefore the following functions have been
          introduced respectively modified in AdGroup.php:
              * (new) getMaxContentCpc()
              * (new) setMaxContentCpc()
              * (modified) addAdGroup (calling parameters changed)
              * (modified) addAdGroupList (calling parameters changed)
              * (modified) addAdGroupsOneByOne (calling parameters changed)
          In addition to that the object structure of AdGroups has an additional attribute: maxContentCpc
              * (new) maxContentCpc

        - The object structure of Campaigns has a new attribute as well: isEnabledSeparateContentBids.
          For consistency reasons the attribute isOptimizeAdServing has been renamed:
              * (old) isOptimizeAdServing -> (new) isEnabledOptimizedAdServing
              * (new) isEnabledSeparateContentBids
          This introduces respectively modifies the following functions:
              * (old) getIsOptimizeAdServing() -> (new) getIsEnabledOptimizedAdServing()
              * (old) setIsOptimizeAdServing() -> (new) setIsEnabledOptimizedAdServing()

        - Campaigns now have a networkTargeting which contains one or multiple values from the enumeration
          networkTypes: GoogleSearch, SearchNetwork and ContentNetwork. This replaces the old
          isActiveInSearch and isActiveInContent attributes.
              * (new) networkTargeting
              * (new) getNetworkTargeting()
              * (new) setNetworkTargeting()
              * (removed) getIsActiveInSearch(), setIsActiveInSearch()
              * (removed) getIsActiveInContent(), setIsActiveInContent()

          The campaignNegativeKeywords attribute is depreciated and has been removed. Please use
          campaignNegativeKeywordCriteria respectively campaignNegativeWebsiteCriteria instead
              * (new) campaignNegativeWebsiteCriteria
              * (new) campaignNegativeKeywordCriteria
              * (removed) campaignNegativeKeywords

          This influences the Campaign functions:
              * (modified) addCampaign() (calling parameters changed)
              * (modified) addCampaignList() (calling parameters changed)
              * (modified) addCampaignsOneByOne() (calling parameters changed)

          Please check out the changed object hierarchy and the new class structure:
          -> http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/resources/apility_organigram.png
          -> http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/resources/apility_hierarchy.png

        - KeywordTool functionality added
              * (new) getKeywordVariations()
              * (new) getKeywordsFromSite()
          (Thanks to Richard Lynch for the patch for 1.1.0 to use this feature before the 1.3.0 release)

        - Bugfix for the "This account is empty" problem.

        - All modifying operations that are emulated by first removing and then re-adding have
          been modified to first "re-"adding and then removing to make sure that the old value
          remains in case of policy problems with the new value (concerns Keywords, Criteria, Creatives).
          (Thanks to Thomas GrÃ¼bel for this proposal)

        - New function to create an AdWords account (customers need explicit permission from Google to
          use this method)
              * (new) createAdWordsAccount
              * (new) helper functions: createDefaultAdsCoverageXml()
                                        createContactInfoXml()
                                        createEmailPreferencesXml()
                                        createCardInfoXml()

        - Updated the test suite.

        - Further improvements in the docs.

        - Debug mode for SOAP related details added.
          To enable debugging set define("IS_ENABLED_DEBUG_MODE", false); to true in Clients.php. To see the
          debugging information for the SOAP headers and requests after any APIlity function call
              * (new) print_r($soapClients->getLastSoapRequests());
              * (new) print_r($soapClients->getLastSoapResponses());

1.1.0   !! Major update !!

        However, this version is hopefully completely downwards compatible to versions 1.0.x
        (causes some "missing parameter" warnings)

        - APIlity now supports CPM-based bidding. This comes along with a new class
          Criterion.php and some changes to the already existing AdGroup and Campaign
          class.

          Please check out the changed object hierarchy and the new class structure:
          -> http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/resources/apility_organigram.png
          -> http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/resources/apility_hierarchy.png

          The new Criterion related functions can be found in the corresponding
          section of the docs:
          -> http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/reference.html#criterion

        - AdGroups now have an additional maxCpm attribute. This influences respectively
          introduces the following functions:
                       * addAdGroup() (calling parameters changed)
                       * getMaxCpm()
                       * setMaxCpm()
                       * getAllCriteria()
        - Campaigns can now have CampaignNegativeCriteria in addition to the traditional
          CampaignNegativeKeywords. For consistency reasons, the following functions
          have been renamed (redirecting functions are kept for compatibility reasons):
                       * (old) getCampaignNegativeKeywords() -> (new) getCampaignNegativeKeywordCriteria()
                       * (old) setCampaignNegativeKeywords() -> (new) setCampaignNegativeKeywordCriteria()
          Two new functions have been added:
                       * getCampaignNegativeWebsiteCriteria()
                       * setCampaignNegativeWebsiteCriteria()
        - Reports now contain the new CPM attribute.
        - The Report class offers two new functions:
                       * downloadXmlReport()
                       * downloadCsvReport()
          This allows (re-)downloading of already existing reports.
        - The Info class offers a new function:
                       * getUnitCount()
          (Thanks to Kunaal and Solitary for providing this one.)
        - The APIlity test suite has been upgraded to reflect the changes of APIlity 1.1.0
        - Bugfix in Campaign.php for one-element CampaignNegativeKeyword arrays
          (Thanks to Laurent Edel for providing this one.)
        - WSDL caching is now enabled by default.
        - Minor bugfixes in the docs.

1.0.1a  - APIlity now reflects the changes in the TrafficEstimate service
               new attribute "clicksPerDay"
               removed attributes "impressions", "ctr", "notShownPerDay"
        - The documentation has been changed to a proper CSS-based layout

1.0.1   - APIlity now supports all GeoTargets (cities, countries, metros, regions).
          IMPORTANT: this comes along with changes to the object structure of Campaign objects. The
                     countries attribute has been replaced by two new attributes:
                       * geoTargetType
                       * geoTargets.
                     In addition to that, the parameters for functions located in
                       * Report.php
                       * Campaign.php
                     have been changed. The values of the previous comma-separated parameter strings
                     must now be put in arrays. In short:
                       old: $values = "value1, value2"
                       new: $values = array(value1, value2)
        - Reports now use the new getGzipReportDownloadUrl function
        - APIlity now prints a notice when an account is empty (i.e. has no Campaigns in it).
        - APIlity now comes with a complete test suite (view the Readme_TestSuite.txt file for details)
        - Possible security issue with authentication.ini: please read the "Getting started" section of
          the index.html file in the doc folder. Nothing to worry about but to be aware of.
        - The documentation (mainly index.html) was updated and now covers all changes.

1.0.0e_fixed
        - APIlity has a new demo to give an overview of how to work with APIlity
          (Thanks a lot to Nathan White for providing this)
        - This version fixes the behaviour of Campaign objects. Now when there is only one
          language, country or campaign negative keyword in the Campaign, the Campaign object
          will no more list these as strings, but as one element array as the reference states.
        - This version fixes the behaviour of booleans. Now all boolean attribute values are
          displayed correctly.
        - This version fixes the addXxxList functions in case where only one element is added.
        - This version fixes an encoding issue with German special chars (Umlaute).
          (Thanks to Laurent Edel, Kunaal and Solitary for sending their bug reports and/or bugfixes)

1.0.0e  - The SOAP clients are now loaded only on demand (lazy loading) and WSDL files can be
          cached locally to reduce startup time.
          (Thanks a lot to Nathan White who implemented this)
        - APIlity now checks if its requirements are fulfilled and prints an error message if not.

1.0.0d  - The SOAP clients now provide quota and response time information. This information
          can be retrieved by calling the following functions on the $soapClients object:
            $soapClients->getOverallConsumedUnits()
            $soapClients->getOverallPerformedOperations()
            $soapClients->getLastResponseTimes()
        - The Euro bug has been fixed. Euro signs can now be uploaded transparently like this:
            "This description1 is just 5Â"
          Please not that APIlity uses its own patched version of nusoap.php from now on.
        - APIlity supports CustomReportJobs.
          (Thanks a lot to R. Keith Smith who implemented this)
        - APIlity supports Cross Client Reports.
          (Thanks again to R. Keith Smith who also implemented this)
        - Error reporting has been extended in case of policy violations which are now
          easier to debug.
        - APIlity now knows its current working directory. This is useful for putting APIlity
          somewhere and sharing it with several different APIlity-based applications.
          (Thanks a lot to Thomas GrÃ¼bel who implemented this)
        - Simplified addCampaign(), addCampaignList() and addCampaignsOneByOne() function
          parameters when there are no Campaign Negative Keywords
        - Camapigns do now allow "all" as languages and countries

1.0.0c - Added support for Animated Image Creatives
       - Added ability to get client login email addresses via two new functions:
           getManagersClientAccounts() for the current manager
           getClientsClientAccounts() for the current client of the current manager

1.0.0b - Huge performance improvements in all getAllXxx functions.
       - Campaign isOptimizeAdServing attribute API querying (quota-consuming) can be switched off.
       - Modified nusoap.php in a way that namespaces don't interfere when PHP5's SOAP is installed
         (Thanks a lot to Nathan White for pointing us to these problems.)

1.0.0a - Implemented possibility to upload Image Creatives by three new functions:
           addImageCreative()
           addImageCreativesOneByOne()
           addImageCreativeList()
         This comes along with changes in Creative.php as there are now two objects namely
         TextCreative and ImageCreative that inherit both from the Creative object.

1.0.0  - Minor changes in docs.

0.9.3c - Implemented new Quality Based Bidding features (Keywords now have minCpc attribute).
       - Added two new functions:
           matchMaxCpcsToMinCpcs() for whole AdGroups
           matchMaxCpcToMinCpc() for single Keywords
       - Restructured trafficEstimate.php to reduce SOAP overhead.
           getEstimate() functions for estimating existing Keywords/AdGroups/Campaigns in one go
           getNewKeywordEstimate() function for estimating single new Keywords
           getNewKeywordListEstimate() function for estimating sets of new Keywords
       - Fixed some minor typos in documentation.

0.9.3b - Further improvements in documentation.
       - Fixed small bug with PHP4/PHP5 incompatibilities in setHeaders().
       - Changed cURL user agent to ["cURL version"+gzip] for both PHP4 and PHP5.

0.9.3a - Changed doc folder structure.
       - Huge improvements in documentation.

0.9.3  - Changed folder structure.
       - Added apility.php as central required file to be included.
       - Added Authentication.php for managing authentications.
       - Added authentication.ini as default authentication (can be overwritten).
       - Added settings.ini where APIlity's behaviour can be controlled.
       - Changed Clients.php so now there is only one (singleton) object holding all clients.
       - Clients can have several authentication contexts and so provide better flexibility.
       - Added addXxxList functions in addition to addXxxOneByOne functions.
         (addXxxList failing completely when one element fails but causing no SOAP overhead)
         (addXxxOneByOne not failing completely when one element fails but causing a lot of SOAP overhead)
       - cURL now retrieves reports with gzip compression saving large amounts of bandwidth.
       - Changed error management completely, added Fault.php and errorReporting.php.
         (Selection between HTML errors and fault objects, possibility of maintaining central error collecting array)
       - Fixed bug when there is only one AdGroup/Campaign in AdGroup.php and/or Campaign.php.
       - Several minor optimizations.

0.9.2g - Added PHP5 support for pulling reports (PHP4: DOMXML, PHP5: DOM), so now both PHP4 and PHP5 should work.
       - cURL now reports an error if cURL OpenSSL download fails (or Curl_OpenSSL is not even installed) when downloading reports.
       - Fixed report maxCpc. Now in currency unit (and not in micros).
       - Fixed a little bug in docs.

0.9.2f - Reports can now be retrieved in bzip2 file format for archiving purposes.

0.9.2e - Fixed a small bug with type casts which used to evaluate if("false") to TRUE. Now it correctly evaluates if(0) to FALSE.
       - Updating local objects now _after_ the SOAP call so in case of an error, there still is consistency.
       - Fixed report grandtotal CPC and cost. Now in currency unit (and not in micros).
